Poco was launched as a Xiaomi brand back in 2018, swiftly gaining popularity thanks to its first smartphone - the Poco F1 - which offered top of the line specifications at an affordable price. Poco was separated into an independent brand by the Chinese electronics giant in 2020, before the launch of its second phone.
